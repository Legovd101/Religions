 CK3_NAME: "Crusader Universalis"
 CK3_DESC: "The maps of Europe have changed since the 11th century. An ambitious player, perhaps a gift from God, perhaps a spawn of the Devil, drove the business of Europe towards one goal. But can this ambitious player control the unfolding of an entire planet for four more centuries without losing their supernatural qualities?"
 CK3A_NAME: "Once Upon A Time"
 CK3A_DESC: "The world remained unchanged during lengthy centuries. Even the most rebellious warmongers remained quiet and nobody tried to murder his neighbor. Yet this time of stagnation, a gift of a Devil for sure, has to end. Today, the 11th of November, in the year of our Lord 1444, the Renaissance began, a new movement that will destroy the eternal status quo."

Surprisingly, all the shamans of these people accept this and follow their superiors without question. These people claim that once they were much like us, but that they have discovered greater truths about the universe and that in doing so they have been able to beat back those who would challenge the old ways."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.4.a: "And what are these greater truths?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.5.t: "The Horsemasters"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.5.d: "We knew that one could tame a horse and use it for everything ranging from message delivery to battle, but we did not realize that we did not know true mastery until we saw the followers of Tengri ride near [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. They did things with their horses that we never thought possible. They attribute part of their people's success to Tengri, the god of the sky. These horsemasters have agreed to teach us how to better handle our own horses so long as we agree to offer our own thanks to Tengri."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.5.a: "May Tengri favor us."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.6.t: "The Great Defenders"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.6.d: "For many seasons we had heard of a people who had staunchly defended their ways, turning back every invader and ignoring all missionaries. No nation could break these people according to the rumors. We made inquiries and were able to meet some of these fabled peoples. They speak of their devotion to their gods, especially Divas, who rules over all others and Pelkkunas, god of thunder. They have shown us their rites and rituals and have encouraged us to emulate their ways so that we too may be granted the divine protection of Divas."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.6.a: "We shall be the Defenders of Pelkkunas."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.7.t: "The Hunters"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.7.d: "A group of hunters have come to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], but these are no ordinary hunters. They dress in strange garb and speak a strange tongue. Through translators we have been able to determine that these hunters have come here on a sacred expedition. Their people believe that all animals have an Emuu, an ancestral mother who must be prayed to when you hunt. In order to ensure that the Emuus will be appeased, these hunters have been traveling to discover the names of new Emmu who are not native to their homeland and as such unknown to them. They have implored us to help them ensure that no animal is ever again hunted without first appeasing the Emmus."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.7.a: "A noble cause."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.8.t: "The Three Tiered Tree"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.8.d: "Visitors from a far off land have arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. They bring with them an interesting idea, that the world is perched on a tree, specifically in the middle. The upper branches of this massive "
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.8.a: "So we lie in the center then?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.9.t: "Zun The Lawgiver"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.9.d: "We have met people who worship the sun, who they say is the god Zun. Zun is the lawgiver and judges all. Men must aspire to be just and kind in order to live up to the expectations of Zun. Those who commit heinous crimes may be submitted to Zun directly for judgement, by leaving them alone in a desert with no food or water for one week. If the person is found alive after this time, they are deemed to have been judged fit for rehabilitation by Zun. It is said that no-one who has survived has returned the same. Their insistence on justice and fairness has struck a chord with many of our people."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.9.a: "Praise the sun!"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.10.t: "The Divine Presence"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.10.d: "Strangers from a far-away land have recently encountered us, they bring with them their beliefs. They claim that in order to achieve true happiness in one must dedicate their life to prayer, diligence and devotion. With these one could do many things, including banishing demons. These strangers also claim that houses must be built with extra seats in them for the protecting gods. Already we have heard reports of extra chairs being built in houses near where the strangers visited."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.10.a: "We must study this further."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.11.t: "The Olympians"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.11.d: "Traveling scholars have arrived in the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. They spend their days arguing with everyone and anyone, oftentimes leading circling arguments that end up with the scholar's partner arguing against what he had stood for just an hour previously. These scholars claim to be the honorary descendants of a long tradition that began centuries ago in a small place called "
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.11.a: "An unexamined life is not worth living."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.12.t: "The Other"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.12.d: "As we have gradually seen more of the world, we have come to realize that there are many peoples who are similar to us, even if they are not perfect mirrors. They have their own rituals, gods and beliefs. As we have interacted with these people, there has naturally been an exchange of culture. It is not unusual nowadays to find local families making a sacrifice to a god known mainly in a land that would take months if not years to reach."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.12.a: "We are more alike than we are different."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.39.aa: "So long as they follow the true traditions."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.39.aa.tt: "A large number of Samaritan immigrants settle in the [Root.GetName] province."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.39.ab: "So long as they are true believers."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.39.ab.tt: "A large number of Karaite immigrants settle in the [Root.GetName] province."

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.39.ac.tt: "A large number of [jewish_immigrants_origin.Religion] immigrants settle in the [Root.GetName] province."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.49.aa: "So long as they recognize Mazdak."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.49.ab: "So long as they follow the right path."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.49.ac: "So long as they know truth."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.51.t: "Shamans Approve of Hierarchy"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.51.d: "It appears that our attempts to organize the shamans into a viable hierarchy has been met with success. It appears that most shamans like the new order that has been imposed as it standardizes their practices meaning that they can go anywhere without having to worry about upsetting the local population. In addition, many find a hierarchal structure to be reassuring, as it leaves no questions as to who has greater authority in cases of dispute. Overall this has greatly increased not only the shamans' happiness, but our people's as well."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.51.a: "Excellent!"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.52.t: "Shamans Disapprove of Hierarchy"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.52.d: "It appears that our attempts to organize the shamans into a viable hierarchy has been met with disaster. Use to having almost total authority within their area of control, many shamans have been chafing under what they call "
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.52.a: "Wasn't a hierarchy supposed to stop this nonsense?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.53.t: "Veneration of the Ancestors"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.53.d: "Our people have always honored those who came before, and know that they watch over us still, guiding those who seek them. In order to honor our beloved ancestors, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has conducted a large ceremony in their honor. Attended by thousands, the ceremony went better than expected. Even better, the harvest has been unusually good this year, and many attribute it to the pleasure of the ancestors."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.53.a: "May they continue to watch over us."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.54.t: "Clamor For Reform"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.54.d: "Many of our subjects in [Root.GetName] have been exposed to the reforms that have been proposed in order to supposedly bring ourselves into the modern age. Rather than being repelled by these radical changes, the citizens of [Root.GetCapitalName] have been embraced the idea with gusto and several key figures have risen up in support of the reforms. If we wish to put a stop to this, we will need to act sooner rather than later."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.54.a: "Reform can be good."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.54.b: "Let's nip this in the bud."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.55.t: "Sacrifices For Divas"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.55.d: "Things have not been going amazing in [Root.GetName] recently. The harvest has been poor and several prominent trading companies have had unexpected setbacks. Nothing that defines a crisis just yet, but the people demand that we take some kind of action. A popular demand has been for the government to offer a large sacrifice to Divas, chief of the gods. Should we risk Divas's wrath?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.55.a: "It's worth a try."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.55.b: "A waste of time and money."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.56.t: "Sacrifice Successful"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.56.d: "Ever since we made our sacrifice to Divas a while back, things have been going exceptionally well. The poor harvest has been forgotten behind the wonderful one we just had and the trading companies have recovered their losses and then some. With patriotism running at an all time our recruiters have had a huge influx of new recruits eager to repay their good fortune with service. It appears that Divas has taken kindly to our offerings and has rewarded us accordingly."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.56.a: "Glory to Divas!"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.57.t: "Sacrifice Unsuccessful"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.57.d: "It does not appear that Divas has looked kindly upon our sacrifice. The harvest has continued to be poor and several previously wealthy merchant companies have now gone completely bankrupt. The people have not looked kindly on us for their troubles."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.57.a: "Maybe we should've sacrificed cows instead of goats..."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.58.t: "The Great Defense of [Root.GetName]"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.58.d: "We have come under attack by heathens and heretics who would dare defile our sacred ways and our traditions. As proud followers of Divas and Pelkkunas we are obligated to defend [Root.GetName] to the last man."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.58.a: "Rise countrymen, and save [Root.GetName]!"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.59.t: "Romuvans Migrate to [Root.GetName]"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.59.d: "It appears that the small Romuvan community in [Root.GetCapitalName], [Root.GetName] is famous among the greater Romuvan community. We have been approached by a rather large group of Romuvan migrants who wish to join their kin in [Root.GetName]. They have promised to work for the state in exchange for our acquiescence, using their knowledge of fortifications to improve the province's defensibility."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.59.a: "We welcome our Romuvan brethren and sistren!"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.59.b: "We don't want their kind here."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.60.t: "Uncontrollable Poaching"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.60.desc: "Recently [Root.GetName] has become a haven for poachers and game hunters. These people do not kill for need, instead they kill only for profit or sport. A staggering amount of meat that could have fed whole villages has gone to waste and the people have grown restless at the continued inaction of the local authorities. If we do not take action, we risk angering the Emmus, the ancestral mother spirits of the animals and our own people."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.60.a: "Send in the military to clear them out."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.60.b: "The local authorities just need to be "
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.60.c: "That reminds me, I wanted a new ivory statue."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.60.d: "So, how do *I* get involved?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.61.t: "Animal Population Boom in [Root.GetName]"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.61.d: "For the last few years [Root.GetName] has had an almost unprecedented level of animal growth. Many see this as the Emmus thanking us for ridding [From.GetName] of poachers awhile back. Regardless of the reason, the huge boom has provided extra meat to the local population and more animals means more animal byproducts. Lucrative animal byproducts."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.61.a: "The Emmus have honored us."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.62.t: "Poaching Spreads"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.62.desc: "Believing that the rise in poaching incidents would be temporary we chose to not take any significant actions against the poachers. However, this fad does not seem to be dying as it has spread to [Root.GetName] and now they too have a poaching epidemic. Should we finally put our foot down?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.62.a: "That's it, send in the military."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.62.b: "*Sigh*, how much is this going to cost?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.62.c: "Kill them, all of them."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.62.d: "So you're saying lion heads are on sale again?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.62.e: "Or we can take advantage of the obvious demand."

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.63.desc: "Recently [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName], heir of [Root.GetName] decided to go out on a grand hunt with [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] retainers. The [Root.Heir.GetTitle]'s expedition almost met with disaster when [Root.Heir.GetName] ended up separated from the rest chasing their quarry. [Root.Heir.GetName] ended up in a clearing in the woods. Alone, [Root.Heir.GetName] was suddenly faced with a lion that had been resting nearby. Thinking quickly, [Root.Heir.GetName]..."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.63.a: "Used the sidearm [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] had kept handy."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.63.b: "Used [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] horse as bait to give [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] time to take on the Lion."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.63.c: "Drew [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] sword and took it head on."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.63.d: "Personally wrestled the lion into submission, taking it as a pet."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.64.t: "Death of the Royal Lion"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.64.d: "The royal family pet lion, once wrestled into submission and taken home as a prize, has finally died of old age. The royal family mourns the loss of their unusual pet and friend and a formal funeral ceremony was held for the lion's burial in the Royal Garden."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.64.a: "You will be missed..."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.65.t: "Suomenusko Migration to [Root.GetName]"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.65.d: "Apparently having heard of the success of our Suomenusko community around [Root.GetCapitalName] in [Root.GetName], a group of Suomenusko travelers have approached us to ask permission to settle in [Root.GetName] province. They promise to work hard for the good of our nation and obey our laws."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.65.a: "We welcome our Suomenusko family home."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.65.b: "No, no, I think not."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.66.t: "Dance Slav"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.66.d: "Our adoption of Slavic practices has had a most unusual and unexpected result. Dancing styles popular in Slavic lands have become incredibly popular here, especially among the nobility and well to do. This has made the people of our court a highly in-demand commodity not only in the lesser courts of our own country, but in the courts of neighboring countries as well. We have been able to use this opportunity to make connections and find out pertinent information through our court."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.66.a: "May the dance go on!"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.67.t: "Festival Forgotten"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.67.d: "How it happened we do not know. [Root.Ruler.GetTitle] [Root.Ruler.GetName] had it clearly marked off on the official royal calendar, initial preparations were made and guest lists were drawn up. Yet somehow it was all forgotten and the holy day came and went with no official event from the government. Perhaps this wouldn't normally be such a problem, but recently a Slavic delegation accused our government of only superficially following their faith, that we did not appreciate their holy rites and rituals. Now that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has forgotten this event, it appears to lend credence to the delegation's accusations."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.67.a: "It's just a day..."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.67.b: "Nonsense, we just needed more time to properly prepare."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.68.t: "Slavic Migration to [Root.GetName]"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.68.d: "We have recently been approached by a large group of migrating Slavic faithful who are looking to make a permanent home in our country. Now it just so happens that there is a sizeable Slavic community in [Root.GetCapitalName] in [Root.GetName] Province. We could easily settle these people in [Root.GetName] and we know that the Slavic people make excellent soldiers, should we take action?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.68.a: "We shall show them to their new home."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.68.b: "They would turn on us."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.69.t: "Exceptional Horses"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.69.d: "It seems that Tengri has blessed us. Our latest stock of horses has been exceptional, they are far stronger, faster and robust than our normal stock. We have been training them for our army and have been extremely impressed, the enemy will not stand a chance!"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.69.a: "Praise Tengri!"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.70.t: "Poor Horses"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.70.d: "Our latest horse stock has been terrible, the beasts are dim even for their species and are weak on top of that. Our shamans have warned that this is a sign that Tengri is displeased with us and that we must be more vigilant about observing the proper rituals and sacrifices required to keep Tengri pleased. Until we have again regained Tengri's favor, we will need to deal with the poor quality of our horses for the foreseeable future."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.70.a: "Kuk sugor!"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.71.t: "The White Stallion"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.71.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] had the most peculiar thing occur just this month. While visiting the local horse breeder, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was approached by a large white stallion who easily allowed [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to ride him. The breeder was amazed, explaining that the horse in question had been unruly since the day he was born and allowed none to lead him, never mind ride him. Pleased, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] took the stallion home and soon found that the horse was unmatched in speed or power and would only allow [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] or [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family to ride him."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.71.a: "He shall be named 'Shadowfax'."

But alas, [ZZZ_enhanced_white_stallion_name] was not immortal and has finally died at an age that future generations will believe to be fabricated. He has been laid to rest in the same graveyard normally reserved for the royal family and a formal funeral was held."

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.74.d: "A man is dragged in front of you and you can feel the heat of anger coursing through your body as the charges are read to you. The man in question is a powerful trader who frequents your court and often invests in the government. There is no doubt that this man must face the judgement of Zun, but his contributions are just so useful and without him we will surely lose some revenue, at least in the sort term."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.74.a: "All must face the Judgement of Zun."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.74.b: "Surely you have the wrong man?"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.74.c: "We never indulged in his schemes."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.75.t: "Judged Returns"
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.75.d: "When a man or a women is sent to be judged by Zun, most people expect to never see that person again. Zun is harsh and since the punishment is rare, returnees are even rarer, yet it now seems that we have one. Driven out into the desert for the murder of their spouse, they were able to return to us. However, like most returnees, they did not return unchanged. It is said that their personality has changed completely but that they have become extraordinarily good at what they do. They have offered their services at our court as"

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.76.d: "We could not believe it when we heard it, our beloved heir [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] has been accused of murder. Apparently [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] was out drinking and when a peasant refused to give up his seat, [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] murdered him in a drunken rage. Although [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] now deeply regrets the action, it was seen by a large number of witnesses and as the representative of Zun the Lawgiver on Earth, we are expected to dole out the proper punishment regardless of station. For this offense, [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] should be judged by Zun, taken out to the desert with no food or water and left there to see if they can survive."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.76.a: "[Root.Heir.GetName], how could you?"

 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.77.d: "To the surprise of many, [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] has survived [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] judgement. [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] stumbled into [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] barely conscious and collapsed as soon as they were approached, but it is undoubtedly [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName]. [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] is different though, like most who are judged by Zun, [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] has returned a different person. Regardless, news of [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName]'s survival has spread like wildfire throughout [Root.GetName] and the people now see [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] as having been anointed by Zun himself."

Yet we cannot help but feel that something is missing. We have turned to those who came before and we have realized what we were missing. We do not have a proper temple to the gods, not one that can be compared to the ancients anyway. This must be fixed at once, it will be a long and expensive process, but it must be done."

Nervously, he informed us that the omens could not be interpreted in any other way, the gods were displeased and we did not have their favor. It appears as though bad times are ahead for us."
 ZZZ_enhanced_fetishist.85.d2: "The shaman in charge of reading the omens appeared rather pleased as he reported back from the temple. The omens look good and the gods smile upon us. It seems as though our endeavors will be met with success."

In order to facilitate this move, and in order to ensure that everything goes smoothly, the Yazidis have offered their services in our administration for a time.

 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTDESC37: "On the Seventh Day after Igziabeher had created the world, He rested. In His honor, we keep the seventh day of the week holy. During the Sabbath, from sundown the day previous until the stars emerge, we do not work, write or cook. We even do not light any fires. Desecrating the Sabbath is a crime against God's laws.\n\nWord has gotten out that one of our most trusted advisors, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName], often works during Sabbath. While some of the more extreme protesters demand that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] be stoned to death for [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] sinful ways, we do not want to set a dangerous precedent. After all, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] is not the only one at court to violate the Sabbath, even though [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] is the most regular and least discreet culprit. Simply firing [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim] would surely appease the majority, although [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] experience would make it a great loss..."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTA37: "We cannot allow such a poor moral character to represent our government."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTB37: "[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] is too important to our [Root.GovernmentName]. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] will stay."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTNAME38: "Christian Influence"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTDESC38: "Ever since the birth of Christianity, time and time again Jewish have betrayed their faith and undergone conversion by declaring Jesus of Nazareth the prophesied Messiah. While often this happened due to repressions and violence from various overlords, sometimes such actions are taken by theological arguments and charismatic missionaries. Most likely due to the influence of [plati_jew_christian_country.GetName] and their proselytizers, people of [plati_jew_converted_province.GetCapitalName] have openly denounced [Root.Religion.GetName] and converted to [plati_jew_christian_country.Religion.GetName] faith."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTA38: "Ok."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTNAME39: "Funding a new Yeshiva"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTDESC39: "Yeshiva is a Jewish educational institution that focuses on the study of traditional religious texts, primarily the Talmud and the Torah, and halacha (Jewish law). The studying is usually done through daily shiurim (lectures or classes) as well as in study pairs called chavrusas (Aramaic for 'friendship' or 'companionship'). Traditionally, every town rabbi had the right to maintain a number of full-time or part-time pupils in the town's beth midrash (study hall), which was usually adjacent to the synagogue. Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. But now that the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith has finally its own state, the Clergy has mildly asked the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for funding of such establishment."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTA39: "Naturally."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTB39: "Our treasury has other priorities."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTNAME40: "Renaissance and Paganism"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTDESC40: "The ideals of Renaissance are finally fully embraced in [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName]. After centuries of christian dominance over science and philosophy, interest in Roman and Greek scholars of old was once again reignited. So has the interest in pagan thought that was once dominant in Europe resurfaced. Renaissance artists admire antiquity, while learned men debate on classical Greek philosophy. And more daring ones - oppose seemingly archaic views Christianity has on science, education and even social norms. A significant number of them are influenced by remaining pagan kingdoms that still stand to this day in Europe. But perhaps this creative curiosity is only a surface of a deeper desire our culture has for faiths of Old? Is it perhaps time to re-embrace our pagan legacy?"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTA40: "Let us limit the movement to arts and sciences."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTB40: "Pax Deorum!"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTNAME41: "Renaissance and Paganism"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTDESC41: "Renaissance being a movement primarily constituted of fascination of antiquity and pre-christian Rome, had a somewhat different shape in pagan world. Unlike artistic confrontation with the Church, it was a time of national myths, heroic epics, pagan literature and art - all of which was greatly encouraged and supported by priesthood. Theologians delved deeper into secrets of the occult, mystical and shamanic. Many Christian talents that were persecuted by conservative church found safe haven in pagan kingdoms, creating monumental architecture, fascinating paintings and astonishing inventions. Tales of mighty heroes, cunning tricksters and wrathful Gods blossomed like never before. Sacred Groves, Holy Sites and even minor Runestones slowly grew into Exquisite Temples, Robust Monuments and Major Landmarks. For [Root.GetName], it sure seemed like a Golden Age in culture."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTA41: "Curious."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTNAME42: "Codification of Pagan Myths"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTDESC42: "Many traditions and beliefs of old were lost due to Oral tradition practiced by ancient peoples. For a long time, [Root.Religion.GetName] myths and legends were also shared and taught verbally, them rarely being immortalized on paper. Snorri Sturluson described the events in Prose Edda centuries after their actual dates - mostly based on information carried by the words of skalds and bards, portion of which believed to be unreliable. However, with the birth of printing industry, many countries, including [Root.GetName] begun a massive culture campaign with sole purpose of codifying hundreds, if not thousands of tales, stories, songs, traditions and every inch of folklore they could find. Some faiths have experienced 'inflexibility' and saw rise of previously unseen 'fundamentalists', favoring some books and tales as holy texts - no doubt influenced by Abrahamic faiths. This movement was not widespread, however, and the cosmopolitan outlook pagans often shared in their traditions continued on. But if a future Lord or [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] decides to force their religion on others, these texts will surely aid them."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTA42: "Interesting."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTNAME43: "Zoroastrian Diaspora"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTDESC43: "Word has spread among the various exiled Zoroastrian communities of our veneration of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. The fire temples of [Root.GetCapitalName] have attracted particular fame, and now great numbers of Zoroastrians have begun to arrive in the area to start a new life in what they hope will be a more hospitable land. Steady stream of scholars, merchants and other valuable men and women will certainly help the area grow."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTA43: "Excellent."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTB43: "The best shall join our court."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTNAME44: "Merging of Practices"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTDESC44: "The incorporation of cultural and local rituals is quite common and traditions have been passed down in historically Zoroastrian communities such as herbal healing practices, wedding ceremonies, and the like. Traditionally, Zoroastrian rituals have also included shamanic elements involving mystical methods such as spirit travel to the invisible realm and involving the consumption of fortified wine, Haoma, mang, and other ritual aids. Faiths, other than [Root.Religion.GetName], are practiced in [Root.GetName]. The priesthood is clashing between each other in regards to the question of syncretism or purity of faith."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTA44: "Peace in Purity."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTB44: "Purity in Peace."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTNAME45: "Achieving Gnosis"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTDESC45: "Through knowledge, the divine spark that rests inside all humans may be liberated and returned to its heavenly source in the spirit-realm. Our Gnostic tradition of attaining wisdom has resulted in influx of many great minds."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTA45: "Interesting."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTNAME46: "Denouncing the Worldly"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTDESC46: "Ever growing land share the [Root.GovernmentName] controls directly has caused great worries among [Root.Religion.GetName] population. Instead of liberating ourselves from worldly possessions and attaining reunification with the creator, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seems to cherish the temporal world quite a bit."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTA46: "Renounce the Temporal!"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTB46: "They are overreacting..."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTNAME47: "Reuniting with the Creator"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTDESC47: "Many of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faithful have shown greater zealotry than usual - instead of attaining liberation though Gnosis, they decided that the fastest and surest way to reunite with the Creator is through leaving the material body and possessions. Our soldiers are willing to fight more fiercely during the ongoing war, hoping that they might attain liberation. This influx of zealous soldiers also means that laborers are little interested in further growing their wealth."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTA47: "Support the movement."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTB47: "Stop the movement."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTNAME48: "[Root.Religion.GetName] Traditions"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTDESC48: "[Root.Religion.GetName] traditions are still remembered amongst the people of [Root.GetName]. Now that the thesis of Luther has been widely known, more and more important people are openly declaring themselves to be Protestant rather than [Root.Religion.GetName]. We must decide whether to retain a distinct [Root.Religion.GetName] identity or join the wider Protestant Reformation."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTA48: "We shall join the Reformation!"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTB48: "We shall retain our distinct [Root.Religion.GetName] faith."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTNAME49: "Yazidi-[plati_yazidi_muslim_neighbor.Religion.GetName] conflict"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTDESC49: "The Yazidi religion is regarded as 'devil-worship' by Muslims and Islamists. Yazidis have been persecuted by the surrounding Muslims since the medieval ages by neighboring Muslim Arab and Kurdish tribes and principalities. [plati_yazidi_muslim_neighbor.Monarch.GetTitle] of [plati_yazidi_muslim_neighbor.GetName] has been demonstrating particularly violent zealotry, targeting border villages and caravans. It is unlikely that hostilities with [plati_yazidi_muslim_neighbor.GetName] will end soon..."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTA49: "Worrisome."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTNAME50: "Ruler perceived as Reincarnation"
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTDESC50: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is believed to be one of the sacred reincarnations of the Seven Angels. Already beloved and now worshipped - [Root.Monarch.GetName] is carrying great burden of expectations and hopes. Whatever course we take, one thing is clear - Melek Taus truly has blessed [Root.GetName]."
 plati_flavor_ckeu.EVTOPTA50: "I come bearing peace."
